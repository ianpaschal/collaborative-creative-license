Collaborative Creative License 1.0

Copyright (c) [year] [fullname]
================================================================================

                                    PREAMBLE

This License is designed for projects which fall in the area between
“source-available” and “open-source.” Such projects provide more freedom to
collaborators than simply providing the source code, however they do not grant
collaborators or end-users the four freedoms of true “free software” which
typically define “open-source.”

Instead, this License is designed to allow collaboration on a project by those
who wish, while preserving the project’s owner’s exclusive right to distribute
and sell the compiled Binaries.

In this sense, contributing is an alternative method for the community
surrounding a project to further the project’s development, through donation.
In this case, it is code, artwork, animations, sounds, or other assets which is
donated to the project, in place of (or in addition to) money.

This License itself is licensed under the MIT License and be freely copied,
modified, and re-used, provided the following conditions are met:
  - A note is made of any modifications within the new license;
  - The name is changed, to distinguish it from the original;
  - Any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
    modified license differs from this License) are removed.
