## FAQ

### What is the rationale for creating this license with so many alternatives already existing?
_I wrote this license because I saw developers working on games who wanted to open their projects up to communities eager to contribute to realizing the project, but did not want to go full FOSS as this would allow other parties to sell their code. The goal was to allow those who prefered to donate code or assets instead of or in addition to money to do so without the project developer losing their exclusive right to sell the final result. This may not be for everyone (and I myself prefer to just use the MIT license) but I do feel it is right for some developers._

### Is this a “real” software license?
_The short answer is “yes.” The long answer is that anything counts as a “real” license (see: [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL)), however I am a developer, not a lawyer and offer this license under the MIT License. That is to say: it comes with **absolutely no warranty or guarantee.** Use it, or a modified version, at your own risk._

### Can I modify this for my own purposes?
_The short answer is “yes, forks and PRs welcome,” however the longer answer lies within the license itself:_

> This license itself is licensed under the MIT License and be freely copied, modified, and re-used, provided the following conditions are met:
>
> - A note is made of any modifications within the new license;
> - The name is changed, to distinguish it from the original;
> - Any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License) are removed.

_As stated above however, keep in the MIT License in mind: **“The software is provided ‘as is’, without warranty of any kind, express or implied.”**_
